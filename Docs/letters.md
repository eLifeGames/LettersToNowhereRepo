// After --- it's the letter
---
Annie,
Yesterday I found a child's toy in a ruined house - a wooden horse. It was small, one leg was broken off.
I held it in my hands, even though it was covered in dirt. It was strange to think that someone had once played here, where we sit with rifles.
I put it in my pocket. I don't know why. I guess I just wanted to hold something normal.

I'm fine. I await your letters.
Yours, Jack.
